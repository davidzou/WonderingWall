# Installing software

There are different ways of installing software on your Raspberry Pi, depending on where the source of the software lives.

The most common is through command line tool APT (Advanced Packaging Tool), and there is the Pi Store - the Raspberry Pi's own user contributed app store. Also some software can be installed using other package managers.
