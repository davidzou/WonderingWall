# Setting up a web server on a Raspberry Pi

You can use a web server on a Raspberry Pi to host a full website (locally on your network or globally on the internet), or just use it to display some information you wish to share to other machines on your network.

Various web servers are available, with different advantages for usage:

- [Apache](apache.md)
- [NGINX](nginx.md)
